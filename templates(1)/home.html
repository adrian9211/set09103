                <p class="text-center main-page-sentence">The best way to take notes is to write down anything that is important to you. If you are a visual learner, you may benefit from writing down charts or graphs that help you understand a topic. If you learn best through listening, try writing down questions you have about the material or something interesting your professor said. Try to leave out any information that is irrelevant or that you don’t understand. If you don’t understand something, you can always ask your professor about it later.</p>
